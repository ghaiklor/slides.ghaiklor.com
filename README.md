# .slidev

This is the repository where I am holding slides written in Markdown for various events.

## Structure

I structure the slides by date and the title, like in Jekyll static site generator.
The folder name is `<YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DATE>-<TITLE>` where lies the Markdown file with the slides content and the dependencies to build it.

## What is sli.dev?

It is a tool that uses Markdown for slides and renders it in the browser.
It is a really great tool Iâ€™m in love with and found out recently.

You definitely need to see [their website for additional details](https://sli.dev).
